# python_chess_ai
First defines a chess game using linting, unit tests and an object-oriented structure. When this work is satisfactory pytorch will be used to train an ai using reinforcement learning.

To do:
* Create working chess game - In progress
* Create AI model that learns to play chess through reinforcement learning.
* Create AI model that predicts the probability of victory/draw/loss.

Ideas:
* Create UI
* Make the game into an application with an endpoint
* Make containerized players that can act through the endpoint
* Deploy as application that other players can interact with and log the games
* Download chess games from chess.com and used supervised learning to train/pretrain on these. This would ease training considerably.
